# Fictitious Alcohol Demand Data - created by Steve Ludlow

Table - ALCOHOL_DEMAND

Description

The Alchohol_Demand data was created so that a story around price elasticities of demand for beer could be used in Visual Statistics. 
Data on beer consumption in public houses (bars) over 24 months is captured for around 1000 people. This includes own price, competitive prices, household income and hours worked.

Enough fields are available that the main features of Visual Analytics, filters, hierarchies, maps, correlations, and forecasts can also be shown. The log values can then be used to show Price Elasticities of Demand. This data could also be used in Enterprise Guide, Enterprise Miner and SAS/Studio.
